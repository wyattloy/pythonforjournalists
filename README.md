This repository is used in conjunction with the class "JMC 36010: Interviewing and Data for Journalism" at Kent State University, taught by Abe Avnisan and Mitch McKenney.
The files here are specifically for the final project of the class; a data-driven story about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global environment.
